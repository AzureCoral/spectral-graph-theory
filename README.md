## Spectral and Algebraic Graph Theory (Daniel A Spielman)
This repository contains the code for the animations in the video ["CSCI2952Q: Spectral and Algebraic Graph Theory"](https://youtu.be/DQVuFo6CSmE). The video is based on the book ["Spectral and Algebraic Graph Theory"](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/sagt/sagt.pdf) by Daniel A Spielman. The video was created as a paper presentation for the course [CSCI2952Q](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ycheng79/csci2952qf24.html) at Brown University.

``` 

The directories chapter2, chapter3, chapter20 and introduction contain the code for the animations in the respective chapters. However, the introduction folder also contains the manim code for the animations in the introduction, transition and conclusion of the video

There are 3D animations in chapter 3 and chapter 20 that we chose not to include in the final video. The code for these animations is in the respective folders. 

Each folder contains a .py file and an ipynb file. The .py file contains the manim code for the animations and the ipynb file contains the code for the animations in a jupyter notebook so you can render the videos on colab or another cloud service.
